Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio — a collection of projects that demonstrate core ML concepts using real-world datasets. These projects cover a variety of supervised and unsupervised methods and show how data can be used to uncover insights and make predictions. Each project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with a focus on interpretability and practical application.

**PROJECT 1
<br>
<br>
Yelp Ratings - Multiple Linear Regression**
<br>
<br>
A regression project using the Yelp Open Dataset to predict a restaurant's star rating based on a variety of variables such as review sentiment and a whole host of business attributes.
<br>
<br>
**Techniques used:** Multiple Linear Regression, Data Visualisation
<br>
**Key takeaway:** Review sentiment was the strongest predictor; business features had limited predictive power

**PROJECT 2
<br>
<br>
Football Tweet Classification – Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM**
<br>
<br>
A text classification project using a dataset of tweets originating from London to predict whether a post is football-related. The project uses weak supervision to label tweets based on football-specific keywords and compares three supervised learning models on a manually labelled gold-standard set.
<br>
<br>
**Techniques used:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), TF-IDF Vectorisation, Count Vectorisation, Data Visualisation
<br>
**Key takeaway:** Naive Bayes outperformed other models on precision and F1 score, but all models struggled with recall due to class imbalance and the complexity of natural language.
