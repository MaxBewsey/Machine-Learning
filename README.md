Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio - a collection of projects that demonstrate core ML concepts using real-world datasets. These projects cover a variety of supervised and unsupervised methods and show how data can be used to uncover insights and make predictions. Each project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with a focus on interpretability and practical application.

<br>
**PROJECT 1
<br>
Yelp Rating Regression - Multiple Linear Regression**
<br>
<br>
A regression project using the Yelp Open Dataset to predict a restaurant's star rating based on a variety of variables such as review sentiment and a whole host of business attributes.
<br>
<br>
**Techniques used:** Multiple Linear Regression, Data Visualisation
<br>
**Key takeaway:** Review sentiment was the strongest predictor; business features had limited predictive power
<br>

**PROJECT 2
<br>
Football Tweet Classification – Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM**
<br>
<br>
A text classification project using a dataset of tweets originating from London to predict whether a post is football-related. The project uses weak supervision to label tweets based on football-specific keywords and compares three supervised learning models on a manually labelled gold-standard set.
<br>
<br>
**Techniques used:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), TF-IDF Vectorisation, Count Vectorisation, Data Visualisation
<br>
**Key takeaway:** Naive Bayes outperformed other models on precision and F1 score, but all models struggled with recall due to class imbalance and the complexity of natural language.

**PROJECT 3
<br>
Male Loneliness Clustering – KMeans Clustering**
<br>
<br>
An unsupervised machine learning project exploring patterns in male loneliness and emotional behaviour based on survey data from over 1,600 respondents. The project uses KMeans clustering to group men based on how often they express emotions such as crying, seeking advice, physical affection, and feelings of loneliness.
<br>
Later in the project, age is introduced as a feature to examine its influence on emotional openness and mental health reporting. The analysis also includes demographic comparisons and visualisations to interpret the emotional landscape of each group.
<br>
<br>
**Techniques used:** KMeans Clustering, PCA, Feature Scaling, Data Visualisation
<br>
**Key takeaway:** Younger men were significantly more likely to report feelings of loneliness, despite showing higher levels of emotional openness. Older men, in contrast, reported lower loneliness, potentially reflecting greater life stability or less willingness to express emotional distress.
