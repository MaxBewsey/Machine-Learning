Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio â€” a collection of projects that demonstrate core ML concepts using real-world datasets. These projects cover a variety of supervised and unsupervised methods and show how data can be used to uncover insights and make predictions.

Each project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with a focus on interpretability and practical application.

**PROJECT 1
<br>
Yelp Ratings - Multiple Linear Regression**
<br>
A regression project using the Yelp Open Dataset to predict a restaurant's star rating based on a variety of variables such as review sentiment and a whole host of business attributes.
Techniques used: Multiple Linear Regression
Key takeaway: Review sentiment was the strongest predictor; business features had limited predictive power
