Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio â€” a collection of projects that demonstrate core ML concepts using real-world datasets. These projects cover a variety of supervised and unsupervised methods and show how data can be used to uncover insights and make predictions. Each project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with a focus on interpretability and practical application.
